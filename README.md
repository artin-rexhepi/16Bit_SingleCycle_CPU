# 16-Bit Single-Cycle CPU Project

## Overview
Welcome to our 16-bit single-cycle CPU project! This project was undertaken as part of our Computer Architecture curriculum. The goal was to design and implement a fully functional 16-bit single-cycle CPU, capable of executing a subset of instructions.

## Project Description
Our CPU design adheres to the single-cycle architecture, where each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle. This simplicity offers a clear understanding of the CPU's operation and facilitates straightforward implementation.

### Features
- **16-Bit Architecture:** Our CPU operates on a 16-bit instruction set architecture (ISA).
- **Single-Cycle Execution:** Each instruction is executed within a single clock cycle.
- **Instruction Subset:** We implemented a subset of instructions to demonstrate fundamental CPU functionalities.
- **Memory Management:** The CPU interfaces with memory for instruction fetching and data manipulation.
